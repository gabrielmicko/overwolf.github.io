## Legal Stuff

No one likes long texts in legalese, so we tried to keep it as simple as possible. Please keep the following instructions in mind when developing or using in-game apps. 

## Developer terms

It's not a long list, but it must be followed:

1. We do not collect, sell or rent personal information without a user’s explicit permission, and neither can you.

2. You own the rights and intellectual property for your app, we own the rights and intellectual property of our platform.

3. We reserve the right to publish or remove your app. If it’s a good and legitimate application, we probably won’t have any reason to ever take it down.

4. Unless different terms were agreed in a signed contract, Overwolf gets 30% of advertising revenues, just like other appstores out there.

5. Please comply with Overwolf’s EULA and privacy policy.

6. This summary is here to help you, but it doesn't replace our full Terms and Conditions document which you should read at least once before releasing an app.

Please check out our expanded [Developer Terms](legal-developers-terms) and [App Terms](legal-app-terms), and have fun coding!

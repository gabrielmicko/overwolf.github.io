This is an unpacked [Overwolf sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugin-sample/tree/master/sampleapp) that utilizes the Overwolf [Sample Plugin](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugin-sample)

* The DLL file is placed inside of the app’s directory – so if you recompile it, you’ll need to replace the old DLL with the new one inside the folder. Please review the manifest.json file to view how to reference the Plugin file.
* All DLLs should be compiled for the x64 platform.

A plug-in is a .NET class library (DLL) that can contain functions, events or properties written in a .NET language. Your app can call on the pluginâ€™s contents from within the context of the Javascript.

The Overwolf plugin system allows your app to:

1. Implement functionality that is missing from the basic Overwolf API including local file access, networking, playing audio, integration with 3rd party libraries, etc.
2. Leverage existing C#/C/C++ code and use it in your app. This is somewhat similar to [Native Node.js Modules](https://blog.risingstack.com/writing-native-node-js-modules/), however we do not yet support Node.js modules. 

We've created a few simple plugins that might answer your needs as an app developer or give you a good starting point for developing your own, you can find them in the [Overwolf GitHub repository](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugins).

A very useful plugin that we've developed ourselves is the **Simple IO Plugin**. This plugin allows your app to perform different filesystem I/O operations not available otherwise.

You can [read  more](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugins/blob/master/plugins/simple-io-plugin/README.md) about the functions of the simple-io-plugin in the [Simple I/O GitHub repository](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugins/tree/master/plugins/simple-io-plugin).

:::important
We implement a lot of functionality from the simple io-plugin into the [overwolf.io](/api/io) API and the [overwolf.extensions.io](/api/extensions/io) API. Please check it before implementing the plugin in your app.

## Common uses for the plugin

2. Create your own persistent log file on the local hard drive.

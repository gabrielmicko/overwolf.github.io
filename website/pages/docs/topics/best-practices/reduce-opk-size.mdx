As explained in [the SDK introduction section](/start/getting-started/sdk-introduction#opk-package), OPK files are Overwolf's app installation package which includes your app's files: the manifest, source files and other assets. All files are packed in a package which has the OPK file extension.

## Why do we want to reduce OPK size?

Most of the time, basic compression is enough, and the OPK weighs between 1-3 Mb. But sometimes heavy assets push that higher, and the OPK can easily grow to more than 5Mb. This is a potential issue - heavy packages q will take more time to release and download, and run some extra risk of things going wrong under pressure - imagine thousands of users needing to download larger files simultaneously. Moreover, it's a standing policy for us to minimize our footprint and requirements on the user's resources, storage and/or processing power.

## How can we reduce OPK size?
We suggest several proven ways to keep OPK size manageable: 

* Compress images to weigh as little as possible with [JPEGMini](https://www.jpegmini.com/), [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or a similar tool.

* Remove non-critical JavaScript from your app to reduce transmission times, CPU-intensive compiling and potential memory overhead.

* Remove map files before zipping (*.map).  
The Developer tools in Firefox/Chrome are using the maps to link the minified JS/CSS generated files to the original JS/CSS to allow debugging as if the code was not compressed.

* Reduce font sizes.  
Most fonts that are used for large bodies of text are usually quite small in file size, especially if you are using a font delivery service like google fonts. Sometimes, however, designers include fonts that can be over 500KB. In these cases, youâ€™ll need to reduce the character set's weight yourself. More info [here](https://parall.ax/blog/view/3072/tutorial-reducing-the-file-size-of-custom-web-fonts).

* Remove .DS_Store files.  
These files are proprietary Mac/OSX system files which hold attributes/meta-data about the folder it resides in. You're safe to just delete it.

* Remove .git, node_modules etc.
 Remove anything that is not required to run the OW app.

## Update store listing

The Store Listing tab lets you update the app details properties displayed in the Overwolf Appstore, including the app's description, screenshots, and more.
Several fields are read-only properties like name, author, and app visibility. Other than that, you can control all your store app's info through this page.

#### Notes

A few properties are read-only, and cannot be edited. These are: App name, author, and app visibility. 

### Name and Author

### App visibility

When an app is set to **hidden** it becomes "invisible" to users. Only users with a direct download link will be able to access your one-app page in the Overwolf app store and download the app. This setting is usually used during the pre-launch period for final tests.

This property is read-only, if you wish to change your app status to **hidden** please contact the Overwolf team.

Building apps requires the Overwolf client, you can view the [changelog here](/api/changelogs) and find out what's new. This includes new in-game events functionality you can use in your app.

Note that developers don't have to work with the Developers version of the client, but it usually has new features and functions still in testing that might be useful.

:::important
To develop, load or run unpacked or unreleased apps, you have to [whitelist](/start/getting-started/sdk-introduction#whitelist-you-as-a-developer) yourself first.

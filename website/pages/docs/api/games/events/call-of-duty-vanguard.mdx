Please read the [overwolf.games.events](../events) documentation page to learn how to use Overwolf game events.

:::warning

* The implementation of this game's GEP is experimental and is considered a Beta version

* Support for these events is for English only and for 16:9 and 16:10 screen resolutions, the game window must be visible and should run with native screen resolution. 

* This game requires enabling exclusive mode on your OW app's windows. Read more about OW [exclusive mode](/topics/best-practices/exclusive-mode).

* In addition, when developing your app, you must comply with Activisionâ€™s Call of Duty:Vanguard terms and conditions. Supporting que dodging, interfering with matchmaking or any such behavior is strictly prohibited, and will not be approved. If you have any doubt, please contact us directly before starting development.

For more information check our [Game compliance principles](/start/getting-started/game-compliance)

## Game event status

It is highly recommended to communicate errors and warnings to app users. 

Check the current game event status [here](/status/). Alternately, you can easily check that status from your app itself, [using our API](/topics/using-events/how-to-check-events-status-from-app).

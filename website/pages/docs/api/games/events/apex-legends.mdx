## Game event status

It is highly recommended to communicate errors and warnings to app users. 

Check the current game event status [here](/status/). Alternately, you can easily check that status from your app itself, [using our API](/topics/using-events/how-to-check-events-status-from-app).

#### *match_end* note

Currently we have a special case where if someone in your team got a yellow knockdown shield (the one that allows you to self-revive), and your entire team was knocked out, the match end will still fire despite no one reaching a death-state.
This is a very rare case that does not commonly happen in the game, however we're still working on fixing it.

----------| ------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------|
kill_feed | See example below | When information is presented on the game’s UI (top right corner). |                    |     130.0     | 

#### *kill_feed* notes

The following properties are provided:

* local_player_name
* attackerName
* victimName
* weaponName
* action

Action possible values:

* kill
* headshot_kill
* knockdown
* Bleed_out
* Finisher
* Melee
* Smoke Launcher
* Creeping Barrage
* Caustic Gas
* Kunai Melee
* Perimeter Security
* Defensive Bombardment

#### Event data example

```json
{"events":[{"name":"kill_feed","data":"{"local_player_name":"Shargaas","attackerName":"shayan3200", "victimName":"i999n","weaponName":"alternator","action":"knockdown"}"}]}
```
#### "Bleed Out" note

The **weaponName** can return with a "Bleed Out" value. For example:

```
"events": [{
    "name": "kill_feed",
	"data": {
	    "attackerName": "Red_Wizard19TTV",
		"victimName": "SoSochek_1337",
		"weaponName": "Bleed Out",
		"action": "Bleed Out"
    }
}]
```

"Bleed Out" is when something "external" kills you, which is not an enemy player.  
For example, if you are knocked out already, and you are outside of the safe zone, your HP automatically depletes, and when it reaches zero, and you die, you will **Bleed Out**, and the **weaponName** and **action** will return with the "Bleed Out" value.  The same rules apply for the "Caustic" legend gas barrels; if they kill you, you also receive a "Bleed Out."

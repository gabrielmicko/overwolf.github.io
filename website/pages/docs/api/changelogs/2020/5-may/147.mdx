### API and Platform

* New feature: [overwolf.window.flash()](/api/windows#flashwindowid-behaviorcallback)  
  Flashes a window that is not in focus (for example, minimized to taskbar).  
  Support either constant pulses or a single flash - the choice is yours. 
* New manifest flag: [disable_cleanup](/api/manifest#disable_cleanup).  
  If set to true, app local data will not be cleaned up after app uninstallation.
* New API: [overwolf.extensions.io](/api/extensions/io)  
  No need to use the external I/O plugin anymore for your current extension-related I/O functionalities.  
  Now you can easily create, delete, or update files on your extension's [dedicated storage space](/api/extensions/io#storagespace-enum).   
* Allow apps to request [opening the hotkey settings](/topics/best-practices/hotkeys-best-practices#reassign-hotkeys) for a specific game. An example:
  * Current hotkey URL:  
    `overwolf://settings/hotkeys#hotkey_name_in_manifest`.  
  * New hotkey URL:  
    `overwolf://settings/games-overlay?hotkey=hotkey_name_in_manifest&gameId=game_id`.  
    game_id is optional.
* Upgrade to OBS 25.0.0 
  * Update obs-ffmpeg.dll (NVENC encoder).
    That can affect some devs that are trying to capture videos and get encoders errors and a message that the NVEC driver should be updated.
* Updates for the streaming and replay APIs: added a [quota object](#streaming):  
  Allow setting max media folder size in GB, and exclude folders that are not part of this quota.
* Video recording engine updated, and now it supports Vulkan capturing!

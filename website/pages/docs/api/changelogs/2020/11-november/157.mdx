### API

* [overwolf.utils.openFilePicker](/api/utils#openfilepickerfilter-initialpath-callback) - now accepts multiple selection of files.  The selected files will be returned on the callback as an array.
* [overwolf.io.listenOnFile](/api/io#listenonfileid-path-option-callback) - add an indication that the watching on file started successfully.

### Platform

* Release phasing - keep the same distribution per release.  
  When you release version 1.0 to 10% of your users using the phase system and found a major bug - you can release an immediate fix 1.1 that targets the same 10% of your users.

### Bug Fixes

* Full-screen embedded videos no longer automatically repositioned in the top-left corner.

### Dev Console

* We added a "per-version" retention report to compare retention between different app versions. You can see it on your board.

### Game Events

* We're expanding our library with typedef files for the different in-game events, starting with Valorant info updates.  You can find our def file in [this repo](https://github.com/overwolf/types), or as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/types).

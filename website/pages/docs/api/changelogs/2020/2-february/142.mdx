### API and Platform

* New API - [overwolf.settings.hotkeys](/api/settings/hotkeys).  
  Returns an object with hotkeys methods and events.
  * New manifest flag: `hold`: Will be added to the [hotkeys object](/api/manifest#hotkeys).  
    Defines a new type of hotkey - hotkey that works only while you are holding the key.

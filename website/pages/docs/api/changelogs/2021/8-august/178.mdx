* Note that iterations 178 to 179 were combined into a single iteration. 

### Docs

* None.

### API

* [overwolf.window.setZoom()](/api/windows#setzoomwinzoomfactorowid-windowid) can now be applied to a specific window and not to all of the app windows.

### Platform

* Installer:
  * Auto-Launch - Up until now if Overwolf was already installed, downloading and installing an app from the "Appstore on web" will install the app, but it wouldnâ€™t auto-launch the app after it was installed. Now it does.
  * Error Messages - We have improved our installer error messages. They will always include links to our Discord or to our Help Center.
* Analytics - A bunch of new analytics were created in this iteration.

### Dev Console

* None.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug with increased text scaling in Windows.

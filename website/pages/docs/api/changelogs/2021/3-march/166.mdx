### API

* The [disable_cleanup](/api/manifest#disable_cleanup) flag in the manifest.json no longer deletes the app's files in the `%Localappdata%/Overwolf/Extensions` folder.

### Platform

* Overwolf will now restore installed apps in cases where the local database got corrupted.
* Updated OBS to version 26.1.1. - now we have the latest and best recording capabilities.
* Improve the OBS crash reports.
* Overwolf Appstore as a default extension - So the Overwolf Appstore has all grown up, it is now a default extension within Overwolf. Most of you won’t
even notice a change, and that’s good, but under the hood, there are several big differences.


### Dev Console

* Export data to CSV.

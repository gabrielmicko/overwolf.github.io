* New [IO sample app](/api/io#sample-app): Demonstrates how to open and load a file to your app, Display it, Add some content, and Write it back to the file.
    
### API

* New flag for the [OverlayInfo](/api/games#overlayinfo-object) object: [isFullScreenOptimizationDisabled](/api/games#isfullscreenoptimizationdisabled-note). The OW overlay is not visible in full-screen mode for games that require an exclusive mode to interact with the OW app's windows (like Destiny 2, CSGO, and warzone). This indication lets you show the user a desktop notification to switch from full screen to windowed or borderless mode or enable full-screen optimization.

* New low disk space warnings when we are recording: 
  * If you are using the Streaming API, [onStreamingWarning](/api/streaming#onstreamingwarning) event is fired, with the error text `disk_space_warning`.
  * If you are using the Replays API,  [onCaptureWarning](/api/media/replays#oncapturewarning) event is fired, with the error text `disk_space_warning`.
  * It will show in the [obs log](/topics/understanding-ow-logs/logs-obs) as: `On disk space warning...`.

* New [encoding](/api/io#encoding-enum) param to [overwolf.io.listenOnFile()](/api/io#listenonfileid-path-option-callback).

### Platform

* Support capturing rate of up to 120 FPS.  
  You have the option to either change the FPS in the Overwolf settings or App Creators can use it with our [Streaming API](/api/streaming).

### Dev Console

* Internal enhancments.

### Bug fixes

* Recording Final Fantasy XIV no longer fails.
* Game Capture no longer hangs when it fails to record.
* Fixed an issue with the Zoom API.

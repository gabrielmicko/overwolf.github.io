* Rebranding - we’re releasing almost all of Overwolf’s client modules with a new branding.

### Dev Console

* App Channels - a new feature that enables you to create and distribute different app versions for your users /testers. The first part of this feature [announced already on v0.170](#api-1), and now [the second](/topics/developers-console/app-channels) (and last) part is released - the app channels management tools from the dev console. 

### Bug fixes

* Extension tray icons would get blurry when changing display settings (try changing DPI from 100% to 175%).
* Replay API - TurnOffResult typo.
* [GameInfoUpdatedEvent](/api/games#gameinfoupdatedevent-object) Object - fixed the issue that runningChanged is not being updated once a game starts running.
* Fixed the issue that Video recording won't start if game is minimized.
* Fixed a bug where subs oneapp page sometimes won't open.

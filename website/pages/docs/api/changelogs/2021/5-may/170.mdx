### API

* **App Channels:**  
  Channels are no longer exclusive to the Overwolf client, apps can now also have channels; Creators can set a specific channel to use a specific version, this way they can super easily create and distribute beta versions for their apps.
  * *Note that testing is still in progress. We will announce that soon for general usage.* 
  * API: [The overwolf.settings.setExtensionSettings](/api/settings#setextensionsettingsextensionsettings-callback) function now accepts a new property in its [GeneralExtensionSettings](/api/settings#generalextensionsettings-object) object called `channel`, this will set the app to a specific channel.
* **In-app Subscriptions flow:**  
  We now give Creators the option to show the subscription modal inside their apps. You will never have to send the users to the store again.
  * In order for this feature to work, the Creator will need to add `Subscription` to the “Permissions” array in the app’s `manifest.json` file.
  * New API, [overwolf.profile.subscriptions.inapp](/api/profile/subscriptions/inapp): Allow apps to launch the subscription window inside their app and change subscription through the app (includs new permission: "subscription").
  * API: New function introduced to return additional details about the subscribed user, such as expiry date and subscription state:  
    [overwolf.profile.subscriptions.getDetailedActivePlans()](/api/profile/subscriptions#getdetailedactiveplanscallback).
  *  new enum with the 3 available subscription states: active, cancelled, and revoked: [overwolf.profile.SubscriptionState](/api/profile/subscriptions#subscriptionstate-enum).
  * [overwolf.profile.getCurrentUser](/api/profile#getcurrentusercallback) - this API now also returns the user’s display name.

### Platform

* .NET 4.8 implementation - we’ve upgraded the .NET version Overwolf uses to 4.8.

### Dev Console

* Subscriptions statistics page was added

### Bug fixes

* Fix [overwolf.utils.openUrlInOverwolfBrowser](/api/utils#openurlinoverwolfbrowserurl): allow to open tab and redirect back to extension when origin URL is at 'externally_connectable' and to tab was open from the same extension.
* Overwolf no longer reloads apps when a secondary GPU process is being created.
* Fixed a typo in setRequiredFeatures when getting the “Provider not ready” error, what was once `succedss` is now `success`.

### Docs
- Updated the documentation to reflect the new API changes listed below.
- Added documentation of the [overwolf.games.GameInfoType](/api/games#gameinfotype-enum) Enum.

### API
- Updated API: [`overwolf.streaming`](/api/streaming) [EXPERIMENTAL]:
  - ABSTRACT - It is now possible to choose to capture audio from a game and other specific audio processes, rather than only the entire desktop's audio.
  - [`overwolf.streaming.getCapabilities`](/api/streaming) - New method for obtaining all streaming capabilities in one place, for both video and audio.
    - Returns a callback with [`overwolf.streaming.StreamingCapabilities`](/api/streaming).
    - Of particular note is the new `audioProcessCaptureSupported` flag, that lets us know if `filtered_capture` can be enabled.
  - [`overwolf.streaming.StreamAudioOptions.game`](/api/streaming) has been changed to [`overwolf.streaming.GameAudioDevice`](/api/streaming). The new field `filtered_capture` has been added, and can be used if `audioProcessCaptureSupported` returned true (this depends on the machine running the app, so make sure to always check it!).

- New API: [`overwolf.games.tracked.getRunningGameInfo`](/api/games/tracked#getrunninggameinfocallback) - New method for obtaining game info from tracked games, similar to [`overwolf.games.getRunningGameInfo`](/api/games).
  - This method will only work if `tracked` and `track_all_games` are both set to true in the [app manifest](/api/manifest#launch_event_settings-array), but it will work on **all** games, regardless of whether they're supported or not.
  - Keep in mind that an unsupported game that was tracked still won't necessarily work as intended, so be sure to test that it works for your specific use case!

### Platform
- Several improvements to Overwolf dll stability.

### Bug Fixes
- [`overwolf.games.getRunningGameInfo`](/api/games) will no longer return a monitor handle of 0 in certain edge cases.

### API
- [`overwolf.utils.checkForClientUpdates()`](/api/utils) - This new method can be used to check whether an Overwolf update is available.  
 Example of the returned callback: 
    ```
      channel: "Developers"
      currentVersion: "0.191.0.4"
      hasUpdate: false
      newVersion: null
      success: true
      updatesDisabled: false
    ```
    Please note that Overwolf will stop displaying the overlay in-game if it was updated while the game was running.
 -   [`overwolf.windows.getWindow()`](/api/windows) - This methods returns 
 the WindowInfo object for any window that has been called with `overwolf.windows.obtainDeclaredWindow`. It's better to use this method instead of using 
 `obtaintDeclaredWindow` if the the window you are refering to has already
been declared.

### Platform
New `manifest.json` properties:
 - [`auto_relaunch_on_crash`](/api/manifest#auto_relaunch_on_crash)
   - Relaunches an app if it crashes.
   - If the app crashes consecutively more than 5 times, we will stop trying to relaunch it.
 - [`open_dev_tools`](/api/manifest#open_dev_tools)
   - Used for debugging, automatically opens the dev tools when an app window opens. 

### Bug Fixes
- `overwolf.media.videos.createVideoCompositionFiles()` - Fixed a possible audio
syncing issue when composing more than 2 files.
- `overwolf.media.videos.createVideoComposition()` - Fixed a possible error when
having more than two segments.
- Reduced internal cache when checking for a possible app update when using 
"test" channels. This will hopefully reduce the time frame from the moment a developer updates
the "test" channel until the update reaches the users.
- Fixed a descrepency in the storage paths when an app's display name was added.
- Fixed an issue where non-developers were able to load extensions as unpacked.

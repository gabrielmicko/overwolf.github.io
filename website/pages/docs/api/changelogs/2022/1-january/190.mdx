### API

 * We are removing the following APIs that have been obsolete for a several  months:
   * `overwolf.settings.OnHotKeyChanged()`
   * `overwolf.settings.getHotKey()`
   * `overwolf.settings.setFpsSettings()`
   * `overwolf.settings.RegisterHotkey()`

### Platform

 * Added the "`path`" property to the File object when using the [HTML5 drag & drop feature.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/DataTransfer/files)
 * When launching games, in-game app windows now hide themselves for games that aren't defined in the `game_targeting` property in the `manifest.json` file.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where the Task Bar icon would show the shortcut icon instead of the window icon.
* Fixed an issue with Auto highlights where `match_start_time` could be a negative value if the match closed before the highlight has finished capturing.
* Toast notifications now also work when loading an extension as "unpacked".

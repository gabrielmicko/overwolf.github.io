* All API functions that take callback arguments:  
from now on, we guarantee that a non-null result object parameter will always be returned and it will always contain a |success| boolean field.  
This means no more if (!result || !result.status ...) checks. Instead, this should always work: if (result.success).
* New Overwolf definition file addition -  make your lives easier and your coding experience faster. Full details can be found [here](/topics/best-practices/type-definition-file).

## Protocol Component overview
The WebSocket Game Events Provider (GEP) solution includes the following components:
1. Active Games Folder
2. Game Events Provider (Game)
3. Game Events Consumer (App)

### Active Games Folder
A folder located at “%appdata%/GEP/[Your-Game]”, containing .ini files. Each file contains a two key-value pairs:
- The game’s name -> The game’s websocket’s port.
- "Protocol-Version" -> The supported GEP Websocket protocol version.
- (Optional) Extra **critical** information required for this game's connection

To keep the hierarchy clean, every game is responsible for deleting its file once the game is closed.

:::note
Every game should only support one specific protocol version. It is up to the connecting app to ensure that it can support it, and to potentially support several versions from its side.

### Game Events Provider (Game)
Provides events from the game via a local server WebSocket. The game is responsible for opening the socket, detecting when the relevant events occur, and sending them to all connected sockets.

The game should also keep an updated "game-state" at all times, containing the latest values of anything declared as an ["info update"](#info-updates), to allow an app to synchronize with the game at any point.

To allow the socket to be detected, once the socket is initialized, the game needs to create a new .ini file under its [“Active Games Folder”](#active-games-folder), with the structure described above.

#### Event Types
##### Game Events
Game events refer to fleeting changes in the game. An action performed by a player, a certain interaction with the environment, etc.

Game Events do not directly change the overall state of the game.

Example:
```json title="The player just scored 5 points"
{
    "name": "score",
    "data": {
        "score": 5
    }
}
```

##### Info Updates
Info update events refer to lasting changes in the game. The player exiting the save, a change in the game’s stage, a change to the player's level, etc.

Info update events directly change the overall state of the game.

Example:
```json title="A match just started"
{
    "info": {
        "game_info": {
            "matchStarted":"true",
        }
    },
    "feature": "matchState"
}
```

#### Features
Features describe the grouping of events. At times, there will be a group of changes that occur in the game, potentially taking several events,
but all describing one core "feature" of the game ("Match started", "Match ended", both parts of "Match state").

Features group events together, for easier and more consistent event subscription and handling on all sides.

#### API
##### sendGameEvent
Sends a new game event to a specific connection that is subscribed to that event.

This is a notification, and does not expect a response from the consumer. As such, there is no request id.

Field Name          | Value    | Description |
------------ | ------------| ------------- |
jsonrpc | 2.0 | The protocol version |
method | sendGameEvent | The action to perform |
params | Object containing event name and data | No parameters |

##### sendInfoUpdate
Sends a new info update event to a specific connection that is subscribed to that update.

This is a notification, and does not expect a response from the consumer. As such, there is no request id.

Field Name          | Value    | Description |
------------ | ------------| ------------- |
jsonrpc | 2.0 | The protocol version |
method | sendInfoUpdate | The action to perform |
params | Object containing event name and data | No parameters |

### Game Events Consumer (App)
Consumes events from a game via a local client WebSocket. The app is responsible for connecting to the game’s socket, subscribing to the events it needs, and handling them once they arrive.

To locate potential games to connect to, the app should periodically scan the “Active Games Folder”, attempting to connect to any valid connection it deems important.

#### API
The consumer may call these methods on the game, using the json-rpc protocol.

##### Subscribe
Requests to subscribe the current app to new events/features.

Field Name          | Value    | Description |
------------ | ------------| ------------- |
jsonrpc | 2.0 | The protocol version |
id | Unique for each message | The correlation identifier |
method | subscribe | The action to perform |
params | Array of events/features | No parameters |

```json title="Return Value"
{ 
    "result": {
        "subscribedTo"?: string[] // An array of all the events/features successfully subscribed to
        "subscriptionFailed"?: string[] // An array of all the events/features subscribing to failed
    }
    "success": true
}
```

The “success” parameter is true if at least one event was subscribed to. False otherwise.

##### Unsubscribe
Requests to subscribe the current app to new events/features.

Field Name          | Value    | Description |
------------ | ------------| ------------- |
jsonrpc | 2.0 | The protocol version |
id | Unique for each message | The correlation identifier |
method | unsubscribe | The action to perform |
params | Array of events/features | No parameters |

```json title="Return Value"
{ 
    "result": {
        "unsubscribedFrom"?: string[] // An array of all the events/features successfully unsubscribed from
        "unsubscriptionFailed"?: string[] // An array of all the events/features unsubscribing from failed
    }
    "success": true
}
```

The “success” parameter is true if at least one event was unsubscribed from. False otherwise.

##### Sync
Requests a forced synchronization of the game’s current game-state to the app, for all of the info updates the app is subscribed to.

Field Name          | Value    | Description |
------------ | ------------| ------------- |
jsonrpc | 2.0 | The protocol version |
id | Unique for each message | The correlation identifier |
method | sync | The action to perform |
params | - | No parameters |

```json title="Return Value"
{ 
    "result": {
        "gameState": object // An object containing the current state of all subscribed info-events data
    }
    "success": true
}
```

The “success” parameter is true if a gameState was returned. False otherwise.
On failure, the “result” parameter is null.

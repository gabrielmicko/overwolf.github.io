Overwolf uses a three-state system to describe how well an app is currently working. This page describes how to update your app state through the Overwolf developers console.

## Setting your app status

Using the dev console, you can set your app's state following these steps:

1. [Login](https://devconsole.overwolf.com) to the dev console, select `applications` in the left-hand side bar, and choose your app from the list.

2. After choosing your app, browse to the `App status` tab and set the right status:

### Possible app states

There are three pre-defines states we call Green, Yellow and Red.  
When you fetch the status later using an API call, each of the states will get a numeric value:

* Green - Good to go! `{"state":1}`
* Yellow - Some features unavailable. `{"state":2}`
* Red - Critical issues, main app functionality is currently unavailable. `{"state":3}`

For each state you can also set a text that will be available from the API as well describing the state.

## Get your app status

The second step is to fetch your app status from the dev console:

To query the Overwolf dev console, you should call the console API URL with your extension (app) ID:

`https://console-api.overwolf.com/v1/apps/[extensionId]/status`

### Usage example

In this example we fetch the status of the "Game Summary" app: 

```js
fetch('https://console-api.overwolf.com/v1/apps/nafihghfcpikebhfhdhljejkcifgbdahdhngepfb/status')
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function(myJson) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(myJson));
  });
```

### Response example

In case of successful request:

```json
{"state":2,"updates_popup_active":false,"yellow_text":"hi there"}
```
As you can see, the `state` field returns one of three values: (1=Green, 2=Yellow, 3=Red).

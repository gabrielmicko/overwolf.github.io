So, your app is live on the Overwolf Appstore, and you've already gone through the [Technical checklist](technical-checklist) and the [Product checklist](product-checklist). Now is a great time to review your marketing efforts with this checklist to ensure a smooth launch and better chance of achieving your app's long-term growth goals.

There is no one 'correct' way to market and promote apps. You know your users best, and promotions that worked for one app doesn't necessarily apply for a different audience of gamers. With that in mind, here are some ideas for promoting your app effectively based on best practices and lessons that we’ve learned. Use those ideas that fit your app and audience.

The Overwolf team is here for you and we’re happy to evaluate your strategy and assist in any way we can.

:::note
If you have a refer-a-friend program, an in-app store, or prizes you want to hand out, we can help you with RP purchase. Please contact your Developer Relations Manager for more details.
